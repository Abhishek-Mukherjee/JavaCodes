##	Static memebers is not object specific it is class specific so it shares common memory
	among all the objects.
	
##	Static methods can access only static members and methods.

##	We can call static member or methods using class name or object

##	If we have many static members we can create static innerClass and can access it without creating the object
	of outerClass.
	
##	We cannot use this and super inside static methods or static innerClass as they are instance not static.

##	Static methods inside staticInner class can be called using class name.

##	Static blocks are called when the class is loaded.
