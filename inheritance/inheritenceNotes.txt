Parent class has access onnly to parent members but child class have access to parent as well as child 
class members;

In child class parameterized or non-parameterized constructor call parent class's non-parameterized 
constructor. To call parent class parameterized constructor we have to use "super(parameters);"
super keyword indicates the super class or parent class. super() means non-parameterized and 
super(parameter) indicates parameterized constructor in parent class.

super can use to invoke parent class data-members
